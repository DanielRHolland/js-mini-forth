Forth-style Stack Language with C and JS implementations.

JS implementation can be run by opening index.html in a web browser or running `node forth.js`.

Assuming you have clang and make installed, the C implementation can be built with `make build`, then run with `./forth`.

If you also have rlwrap installed, you can run `make run-rlwrap`, to get completions, history, and more pleasant line-editing.

_Be aware:_

 - Neither implementation is finished
 - The implementations have some subtle differences
 - This is a toy, not intended for serious use
