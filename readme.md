Forth-style Stack Language with C and JS implementations.

JS implementation can be run by opening index.html in a web browser or running `node forth.js`.

C implementation can be compiled with gcc (`gcc forth.c -o forth`) and then run `./forth`.

Be aware:
- Neither implementation is finished
- The instruction sets have _different_ missing features
- This is a toy language, not intended for serious use
